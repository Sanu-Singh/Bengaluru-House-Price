This data model is designed to predict the price of a house in Bengaluru, India. The model is trained on a dataset of historical house sales in Bengaluru, including information such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and sale price.

The model uses a variety of machine learning techniques to analyze the data and make predictions about future house prices. The predictions are based on patterns and trends found in the historical data, and the model is regularly updated with new data to improve its accuracy.

Users can input information about a house, such as location and size, and the model will provide a predicted sale price. It is important to note that the model can only provide an estimate and that the actual sale price may vary based on a number of factors not included in the model.

To access the model, users will need to provide an API key and make an API call to the server where the model is hosted. The API call should include the house information in the request body. The response will contain the predicted price in Indian Rupees.

Overall, the Bengaluru House Price Prediction Data Model can be useful for real estate professionals, home buyers and sellers, and anyone else interested in understanding the housing market in Bengaluru.
